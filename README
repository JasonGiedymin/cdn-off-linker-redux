Description: Based on the original ossdl cdn off linker plugin by W-Mark
             Kubacki.  Tradditionally replaced the blog URL with another for
             all files under <code>wp-content</code> and
             <code>wp-includes</code>. Static content can then be handled by
             a CDN.

             Note that this is an alpha release, and some enhancements have
             been stripped.
